# Muledump CORS Adapter

This is a fork of the [Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://github.com/vitvad/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) Chrome extension that has been updated to work specifically with the [Jakcodex/Muledump](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump) application. 

It addresses issues with the former extension ceasing to work in many situations, and it removes the need for user configuration.
